What is the primary focus of flow control in networking?,Managing overall network traffic to avoid congestion.,Ensuring that a sender does not transmit data faster than the receiver can process.,Allocating bandwidth equally among all devices.,Optimizing data routing paths for faster delivery.,Preventing packet loss due to buffer overflow at intermediate nodes.,b,Flow control ensures that a fast sender cannot continuously transmit data faster than the receiver is able to absorb it.
Which of the following is a key characteristic of congestion control?,It is only relevant in point-to-point communication.,It focuses on individual sender-receiver pairs.,It manages the behavior of all nodes in the network.,It requires high-speed links to function effectively.,It ensures that the sender does not overload its buffer.,c,"Congestion control involves managing the behavior of all nodes, including hosts, switches, and routers, to ensure the network can carry the offered traffic."
