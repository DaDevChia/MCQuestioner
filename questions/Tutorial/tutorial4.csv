"In a backoff race scenario involving three hosts (A, B, and C) on Ethernet, what is the probability that Host A wins the race?",0.516,0.350,0.250,0.650,0.750,a,"The probability is calculated as (21+12)/64 = 0.516, based on the possible triples <x, y, z> for Host A to win."
Which types of connections can use full duplex?,"Hub to hub, Switch to hub","Host to host, Switch to switch, Switch to host","Hub to hub, Host to host, Switch to switch","Switch to hub, Host to host, Switch to switch","Switch to switch, Host to hub",b,"Full duplex must be used between two devices capable of running full duplex. Options (b), (c), and (e) in the document are correct."
What is a key advantage of using switches over routers for interconnecting LANs?,Switches operate at layer-3 and provide IP forwarding.,"Routers are plug-and-play, unlike switches.","Switches do not require configuration, making them plug-and-play devices.",Routers have no need for IP configuration.,Switches are more difficult to set up than routers.,c,"Switches are plug-and-play devices, requiring no intervention or configuration, unlike routers, which require IP configuration."
Which layer does a typical Ethernet switch use for forwarding packets?,Layer-1,Layer-2,Layer-3,Layer-4,Layer-7,b,"Ethernet switches typically operate at layer-2, using L2 information for forwarding."
Why are packet forwarding rates higher in switches than routers?,Switches process up to layer 3 while routers process up to layer 2.,Routers do not support spanning trees for packet forwarding.,"Switches only process up to layer 2, incurring less overhead.","Routers are used for small networks, unlike switches.",Switches use dynamic state routing protocols.,c,"Switches process only up to layer 2, which reduces overhead compared to routers, which process up to layer 3."
What is the purpose of maintaining the minimum frame size in Fast Ethernet?,To reduce the number of collisions.,To ensure transmission continues during a collision at the farthest cable end.,To maximize the bandwidth utilization.,To maintain compatibility with Gigabit Ethernet.,To enable spanning tree protocol for routing.,b,The minimum frame size ensures the sender is still transmitting if a collision occurs at the farthest cable end.
How does Fast Ethernet maintain the same minimum frame size as 10-Mbps Ethernet?,By using a smaller RTT and higher bandwidth.,By limiting the cable length to 1/5th of traditional Ethernet.,By increasing the RTT tenfold.,By increasing the transmission time to 51.2 Âµs.,By maintaining a lower bandwidth than traditional Ethernet.,a,Fast Ethernet reduces the RTT by limiting cable length and increases bandwidth to keep the minimum frame size.
What happens when A sends to C in a network of learning bridges?,All bridges immediately know where C is.,Only bridge B1 forwards the packet.,Bridges forward the packet through all interfaces and learn A's location.,No bridges forward the packet as they don't know where C is.,Bridges forward the packet but do not learn any new information.,c,"When A sends to C, bridges forward packets through all interfaces as they don't know where C is, but they learn where A is."
What is the forwarding table for Bridge B1 in Problem 5?,"Host A -> Port B1, Host C -> Port B2","Host A -> Port B2, Host C -> Port B1","Host A -> Port A, Host C -> Port C","Host A -> Port B1, Host C -> Port C","Host A -> Port A, Host C -> Port B1",a,"According to the provided solution, Bridge B1's forwarding table indicates Host A on Port B1 and Host C on Port B2."
"What is the action of Bridge B5 when it receives message (B3,2,B6) from LAN A?","Send (B3,2,B5) to LAN A and LAN B","Send (B3,3,B5) to LAN B and LAN C","Send (B3,4,B5) to LAN C only","Send (B3,3,B5) to LAN A only","Send (B3,5,B5) to all LANs",b,"The solution specifies that upon receiving (B3,2,B6) from LAN A, Bridge B5 sends (B3,3,B5) to LAN B and LAN C."
Which port does Bridge B3 forward Host D to?,Port B2,Port D,Port C,Port B3,Port B1,a,The forwarding table of Bridge B3 indicates that Host D is forwarded to Port B2.
What is the forwarding action of Bridge B4 for Host A?,Forward to Port A,Forward to Port B2,Forward to Port D,Forward to Port C,Drop the packet,b,Bridge B4's forwarding table shows that Host A is forwarded to Port B2.
What happens if node B is within the communication reach of node C in a wireless LAN?,A collision will occur.,The transmission is ignored.,MACA ensures no issues occur.,Node B stops communicating.,CTS frames will not be sent.,a,"If B is within reach of C, a collision occurs due to overlapping communication signals."
How does MACA avoid collisions in wireless communication?,By ensuring no nodes communicate simultaneously.,By using RTS/CTS frames.,By restricting communication to one node.,By prioritizing larger packets.,By reducing the signal strength.,b,"MACA uses RTS/CTS frames to ensure nodes are aware of each other's transmissions, preventing collisions."
What action does a node take when it sees a CTS frame in MACA?,It stops ongoing transmission.,It waits before initiating a transmission.,It sends an RTS frame immediately.,It increases transmission power.,It disconnects from the network.,b,"In MACA, a node waits when it detects a CTS frame, avoiding potential collisions."
What is the role of a CTS frame in MACA?,It initiates data transmission.,It acknowledges the RTS frame.,It prevents other nodes from transmitting.,It establishes a communication link.,It terminates the transmission session.,c,"A CTS frame informs other nodes to defer transmission, preventing collisions."
