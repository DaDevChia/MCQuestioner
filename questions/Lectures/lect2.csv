What is the primary difference between FDM and TDM?,"FDM shares bandwidth dynamically, while TDM shares it statically","FDM allows all users to transmit simultaneously but on different frequencies, while TDM allows users to transmit at different times",TDM allows all users to transmit simultaneously on different frequencies,"FDM is used in Ethernet networks, while TDM is used in WiFi networks","TDM provides guaranteed service, while FDM does not",b,"FDM separates users by frequency, while TDM separates them by time."
"In Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), if two input links with data rates R bps each are multiplexed, what is the minimum required data rate of the output link?",3R bps,2R bps,R bps,1.5R bps,4R bps,b,"Since both input links must be transmitted alternately, the output link must handle both data rates, which requires at least 2R bps."
What is a major disadvantage of Fixed Time Division Multiplexing (FTDM)?,Inefficient bandwidth utilization,High queuing delays,Packets can arrive out of order,Unreliable data transfer,Packet loss during transmission,a,"Bandwidth is reserved for each input, but if the input is not active, the bandwidth remains unused, causing inefficiency."
"In Statistical Time Division Multiplexing (STDM), what happens if the sum of the input data arrival rates exceeds the output link rate?","Bits are queued, and if the buffer overflows, bits are lost",Data is transmitted simultaneously from all inputs,The output link rate is increased dynamically,Excess bits are transmitted during idle times,Input data is discarded before transmission,a,"STDM queues excess bits, but if the buffer overflows, data loss occurs."
What is the advantage of packet switching over circuit switching?,Lower latency,Higher bandwidth utilization,Guaranteed delivery of packets,Dedicated bandwidth per user,Less complex forwarding mechanisms,b,Packet switching allows better bandwidth utilization by dynamically sharing resources between packets.
"In a network using IP, what is the role of the ARP protocol?",Resolve DNS addresses to IP addresses,Map IP addresses to MAC addresses,Route packets between subnets,Encrypt data between hosts,Authenticate network hosts,b,ARP maps an IP address to a corresponding MAC address.
What is the most significant difference between unicast and multicast addressing?,Unicast addresses all devices on the network,"Unicast addresses a single device, while multicast addresses a group of devices",Multicast addresses a single device,Unicast is used for broadcast messages,Multicast is less efficient than unicast,b,"Unicast sends to a specific device, while multicast sends to a group of devices."
Which layer in the ISO-OSI model is responsible for routing packets between different networks?,Data Link Layer,Transport Layer,Network Layer,Session Layer,Application Layer,c,The Network Layer is responsible for routing packets across different networks.
What is the primary function of the Data Link Layer in the OSI model?,Frame aggregation and error control,Establishing end-to-end communication,Routing data between networks,Encrypting application data,Handling socket connections,a,The Data Link Layer aggregates bits into frames and handles error control.
What kind of address does a router use to forward a packet in an IP network?,MAC address,IP address,DNS name,Port number,Subnet mask,b,Routers forward packets based on their IP addresses.
Which of the following accurately describes propagation delay?,Time taken for a signal to travel from one node to another,Time taken to process data at a node,Time taken to transmit a message,Time taken to queue data before transmission,Time taken to establish a connection,a,Propagation delay refers to the time it takes for a signal to travel across a physical medium.
Which factor does NOT contribute to message transfer time in a network?,Transmission delay,Propagation delay,Compression time,Queuing delay,Processing delay,c,Compression is not part of typical message transfer delays.
What is encapsulation in networking?,Combining several frames into one,Adding header information at each layer to a packet,Encrypting data for secure transmission,Fragmenting data into smaller packets,Removing redundant data from a frame,b,Encapsulation adds headers as data moves through the OSI layers.
What does Round-Trip Time (RTT) in networking measure?,The time taken for a message to travel from a source to a destination and back,Time taken to transfer a message from one node to another,Time taken to establish a connection,Time taken to process a packet at a router,Time taken to resolve DNS addresses,a,RTT is the time for a message to make a complete round trip.
What does the D×B product in networking represent?,The amount of data 'in the pipe' during transmission,The bandwidth of a network link,The delay experienced during message transfer,The maximum transmission rate,The time to establish a connection,a,D×B product represents how much data is in transit at any given time.
