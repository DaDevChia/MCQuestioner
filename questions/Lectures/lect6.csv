What is the primary challenge for wireless links in shared medium?,Interference,Limited bandwidth,Exclusive use,Mobility,Spread spectrum,a,Wireless links face interference due to multiple devices sharing the same medium.
What technique is used to spread a signal over a wide frequency band?,Direct sequence,Frequency modulation,Amplitude modulation,Time division,Phase shift,a,Direct sequence spreads the signal by XORing each bit with a random sequence of bits.
Which frequency band is reserved for license-exempt usage?,5 GHz,2.4 GHz,3.5 GHz,900 MHz,All of the above,b,Devices using 2.4 GHz can operate without a license but must follow power restrictions.
Which wireless technology supports mobility between bases?,Bluetooth,Wi-Fi,3G cellular,Ethernet,Token Ring,c,3G cellular networks enable mobility across wide geographical areas.
What is the transmission power limit used for license-exempt devices?,10 Watts,100 Watts,1 Watt,100 mW,Varies by location,d,Devices using license-exempt frequencies are limited to 100 mW to reduce interference.
What problem arises when two hidden nodes communicate with a common receiver?,Collision,Exposed node,Interference,Duplication,Missed transmission,a,"Hidden nodes can't detect each other's signals, leading to collisions at the receiver."
Which wireless technology is backward compatible with 802.11b?,802.11a,802.11g,Bluetooth,4G,3G,b,"802.11g is backward compatible with 802.11b, allowing devices to interoperate."
How is a Request to Send (RTS) frame used?,To initialize frequency hopping,To request channel access,To establish encryption,To modulate the signal,To acknowledge receipt,b,RTS is used to request access to a channel before transmission begins.
What is the primary difference between frequency hopping and direct sequence techniques?,Data rate,Frequency range,Modulation method,Security,Spread factor,e,"Direct sequence spreads the signal over a wider range, while frequency hopping changes channels."
What is the benefit of using MIMO in 802.11n?,Increased security,Higher bandwidth,Wider coverage,Lower power consumption,Greater interference resilience,b,"MIMO allows multiple signals to be sent over the same frequency, increasing bandwidth."
Which protocol does 802.11 use to avoid collisions?,CSMA/CD,MACA,TCP,UDP,ICMP,b,802.11 uses MACA (Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) to minimize collisions.
What issue does the exposed node problem describe?,Interference with hidden nodes,Failure to detect collisions,Nodes unnecessarily avoid transmitting,Data corruption,Packet loss,c,"Exposed nodes avoid transmitting despite no interference, leading to wasted opportunities."
What frame is used to acknowledge a successful transmission in 802.11?,CTS,RTS,ACK,NACK,DATA,c,ACK frames confirm successful reception of transmitted data.
Which wireless standard provides speeds up to 54 Mbps using OFDM?,802.11a,802.11b,802.11g,802.11n,Bluetooth,a,802.11a uses OFDM and supports speeds up to 54 Mbps.
What method is used to select an Access Point (AP)?,Scanning,Hopping,Polling,Tuning,Broadcasting,a,Nodes use scanning to select an AP by sending probe frames and evaluating responses.
What frequency band does 802.11ac use?,2.4 GHz,5 GHz,900 MHz,1.8 GHz,Both 2.4 and 5 GHz,b,"802.11ac uses the 5 GHz band, improving on 802.11n."
Which frame contains the length of data to be transmitted?,CTS,RTS,ACK,Beacon,Probe,b,The RTS frame includes the data length to be transmitted.
Which frame advertises the capabilities of an Access Point?,Beacon,Probe,CTS,RTS,ACK,a,"Beacon frames advertise the capabilities of an AP, including supported transmission rates."
What is a key characteristic of a wireless mesh network?,Centralized control,Peer-to-peer communication,Fixed infrastructure,Low bandwidth,Limited mobility,b,Wireless mesh networks rely on peer-to-peer communication for routing.
What technique reduces interference by hopping between frequencies?,OFDM,Direct sequence,MACA,Frequency hopping,Spread spectrum,d,Frequency hopping reduces interference by rapidly switching between frequencies.
